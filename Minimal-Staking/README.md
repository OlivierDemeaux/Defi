# Takeaway
What's important to understand is that everytime someone stake or withdraw, the totalSupply of token on the contract change and therefore the rewardPerToken is updated (the sum of all previous rewards (rewardPerTokenStored) + the new value of rewardPerToken), wich is the S side of the equation (left side).
